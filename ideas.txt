- custom paws cursor
- paw animation when clicking on buttons (a small transparent one)
- Square design instead of rounded
- date parts more splitted to get a better overview and table of conent for them?
- opening the menus when hovering over sections should get a animation
- add EN/DE support
- custom fonts
- dark/light mode, color design itself should be fern/dark green and kind of beige

- edit pdf parts so theyre displayed direcxtly but if clicking on them it would open the current Vorschau window


You should now rename all the jpg/png files and give them proper names instead of numbers. The location and usage of the pictures should clatify a proper name for them.

Edit current dark/light so it follows system by default and can be changed via the toggle


The animation for the 4 donation cards is broken, the animation for the section underlines still works.

THe banners are bugged again and doesnt take whole x space only the x space of the content, fix that so it uses the whole x space again.
